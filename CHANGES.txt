scikit-multilearn - 0.0.3 (released 2016-MM-DD)

- support for new multi-label classification methods:
    - classsifier chains (CC)
    - multi-label kNN methods: BRkNN and MLkNN
    - all classifiers use sparse matrices internally
    - a general network for clustering label space with a flat classifier
    - the classifiers work with scikit pipelines / CVs

- interface to meka 1.9, meka can work as a scikit-ml classifier
- loading arff files to sparse matrices by default

scikit-multilearn - 0.0.2 (removed due to bug in PyPi)

scikit-multilearn - 0.0.1 (released 2014-12-01)

- initial release
- support for initial set of multi-label classification methods:
    - binary relevance, label powerset
    - RAkEL both distinct and overlapping
    - label cooccurence based distinct partitioning classifiers
- interface to meka 1.7
- ARFF to numpy.array convertion classes and data set manipulation
